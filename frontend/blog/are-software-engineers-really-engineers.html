        <strong>TL;DR</strong>: Yes, but only if the product is tangible.
        Otherwise, no.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I give you my reasoning, I want to go over what other people
        think. From what I've seen, they generally fall into 3 camps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          "It's about the <strong>process</strong>. If you follow good design
          principles, memorize all the best practices, write quality and
          maintainable code... stuff like that is what makes you an engineer!"
        </li>
        <li>
          "It's about the <strong>product</strong>. You can be as detailed and
          meticulous in the process as you want, but if you're just making a
          mobile app, it doesn't matter. To be an engineer, you need to work on
          something more complex and difficult. People who program spaceships?
          Those guys are engineers!"
        </li>
        <li>
          "It's about the <strong>law</strong>. You guys have it all wrong: the
          term 'engineer' has to be interpreted through a legal lens. You need a
          license. If you've got one, you're an engineer. If not, you're not.
          Simple as that!"
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In my opinion, they all make good points. Simultaneously, they all fall
        short in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people in the <strong>process</strong> camp make an honorable
        argument: to be an engineer, you have to hold yourself to higher
        standards. You have to do things the "right" way. You have to be a
        "professional". I like it... but I'm just not sure where to draw the
        line. Is there some predefined checklist of "best practices" that you
        have to follow, ticking off boxes one by one, and then you get to call
        yourself an engineer?
      </p>
      <p>
        The people in the <strong>product</strong> camp make sense. If someone
        coding at NASA or SpaceX called themselves an engineer, I doubt anyone
        would challenge them. If someone built a to-do app and called themselves
        an engineer, it might be a different story. Then again, this camp
        suffers from the same ambiguity as the previous one: where do we draw
        the line? At what point does a product become impressive enough to
        warrant the "engineering" label?
      </p>
      <p>
        The people in the <strong>law</strong> camp are entirely correct... but
        only if you live in a country where the title "engineer" is regulated
        e.g. Canada. That's not necessarily the case for every country.
      </p>
      <p>
        So where does that leave us? It feels like anything goes. Coder,
        programmer, software developer, software engineer... what shall it be?
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who works with software, my take is this: we should think
        about the general public's point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the average Joe thinks about engineering, he's thinking about
        <strong>tangible</strong> objects. Mechanical engineers can show the
        machines they've built. Electrical engineers can point to the
        electronics you use every day. Civil engineers can take you to the
        bridge or the dam that they built. Chemical engineers can produce a
        weird-ass glowing liquid.
      </p>
      <p>...but "software engineers" often can't point to anything.</p>
      <p>
        What we build is invisible. Maybe it exists in some data center. Or on
        the display of a smartphone. Or on a computer monitor. Our product isn't
        tangible. It's just some invisible process running in a box.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that's why this question is even a question in the first place.
        It just doesn't feel <strong>intuitive</strong> that some guy typing on
        a computer and creating something intangible should be called an
        "engineer".
      </p>
      <p>
        And of course, the obvious exception is when we actually
        <strong>are</strong> producing something tangible. A good example would
        be a <a href="https://www.irobot.com/roomba">Roomba</a>. When the
        average Joe asks you what you do for a living, you can say "I'm a
        software engineer" and point to something tangible that you helped
        create: in this case, the Roomba. Personally, I doubt he'd question your
        title.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, we should call ourselves either a "coder", a "programmer", or
        a "software developer". All of these terms are synonymous and perfectly
        respectable, although I'd wager "software developer" is slightly more
        professional-sounding to the general public, if that matters to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And look: I get that a lot of people simply want to call themselves
        engineers. It sounds cool. It makes them feel proud. And if my coworkers
        referred to themselves as engineers, I would respect that, because
        getting along is more important than shoving opinions down each other's
        throats.
      </p>
      <p>But as for me, I'll stick to being a developer.</p>
