      <p>
        April of 2021. I'm finishing up a project idea I'd hatched up a few
        months earlier, but never got around to developing due to uni.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a machine learning web app built for an impressive-sounding
        use-case relating to medicine. I lovingly handcrafted the entire thing
        from scratch, writing raw HTML, Sass, and React which piped data and
        forth from a Node backend, which in turn ran the trained models. It was
        fairly complicated for a one-man hobby project, and I was pretty proud
        of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After deploying to production, I tuned a few SEO settings in Google's
        Search Console and gradually forgot about it as I moved onto a new
        project.
      </p>
      <p>
        A little while later, during some downtime, I was reading up on some SEO
        tips and tricks. In doing so, I remembered my previous project, and out
        of curiousity, I decided to give Google a quick spin to see how the
        rankings were going.
      </p>
      <p>It was doing pretty good... but so was something else.</p>
      <p>
        Right below my website, was a seemingly identical one. Unfortunately
        (and I hate myself for this), I didn't take a screenshot of it, so I
        can't remember the exact details. But IIRC, it had the same title and
        meta description. Puzzled, I jumped in to check it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was an exact, word-for-word clone of my web app. Everything was the
        same. The content, the styling... all of it.
      </p>
      <p>There were only 2 notable differences:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The domain was different (obviously).</li>
        <li>
          The backend didn't work. In other words, when trying to use the web
          forms to submit inputs to the machine learning models on the backend,
          it always gave a "Submission Failure" message. So the whole point of
          the web app - the core product, if you will - was non-functional.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>And then... I did nothing.</p>
      <p>
        This is gonna sound super weird and super stupid... but at the time, I
        didn't think much of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was used to facing a plethora of obscure bugs and strange quirks when
        it comes to software. Somehow, I managed to convince myself that this
        was just that - a bug in the system. A glitch. The idea that someone saw
        my website and deliberately copied it was unfathomable to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that sounds like the dumbest reasoning you've ever heard - it's
        because it is. I don't know what I was thinking. I've heard stories
        about people's work being stolen... but I never thought it could
        actually happen to me. I won't sugarcoat it - I was in denial.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was only a few weeks later that what I had seen randomly popped back
        into my head. "Wait... was my website actually STOLEN?!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately, I felt extraordinarily uncomfortable. I did some research
        on what to do, and was pointed towards a
        <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905?hl=en"
          >tool</a
        >
        by Google to request removals of copyrighted content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I decided to try to find out more about the perpetrators. The
        domain that was hosting the clone was actually a subdomain of a software
        company based in Mexico. Their product? A cloud-based project management
        platform. Yeah. Needless to say, it had absolutely nothing to do with my
        medical web app. Talk about confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
        After looking around a bit, I found some contact information which I
        used to draft an email. I guess in legal terms this would be called a
        "cease-and-desist" letter?
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, you have to understand that I was feeling very
        uncomfortable and out of my element. Like a lot of people, I'm a little
        wary of confrontation and try my best to handle things diplomatically.
        Now I'm in a situation where I've already filed a DMCA takedown request
        and I'm about to confront the people responsible for stealing my
        website. Fun stuff!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here goes nothing. I give my email the subject:
        <strong>Copyright Infringement - Takedown Request</strong>. That should
        get their attention. Now for the content...
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="/assets/images/blog/3/1.png"
          alt="A polite email of me asking the company to take down their clone of my website"
          class="border-2 border-gray-500"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Note the name of the subdomain. That comes into play a little bit
          later.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I want to note that I'm not a lawyer or anything, and I certainly don't
        have the money to hire one. Basically, I don't really have any actual
        power to enforce that they take down the clone. That's why I had to be
        pretty careful in how I came across in the email. Stern, a little
        forthright... but respectful. Did it work? Well, one day later, I got a
        response from a company rep:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="/assets/images/blog/3/2.png"
          alt="A company representative replies to my email, simply asking me to schedule a call"
          class="border-2 border-gray-500"
        />
        <figcaption>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/_JOsUhrrxeg"
            >https://youtu.be/_JOsUhrrxeg</a
          >
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>No thanks, bro! (In case you couldn't get that link to work.)</p>
      <p>
        At this point, I've noticed that their clone is now AWOL. Still on
        Google, but returning a 404. As far as I'm concerned, they've done what
        I wanted - they took the clone down. Now the onus is on Google to follow
        through on my request to take the search result down. I've got
        absolutely no interest in talking about this any further with the rep -
        I'd rather put this uncomfortable experience behind me.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="/assets/images/blog/3/3.png"
          alt="I let the company know that they did what I wanted, and that there's no need for a call"
          class="border-2 border-gray-500"
        />
        <figcaption>Our business is done here. Got it?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I hit send, and hope that I never hear a word from these people ever
        again. But I get one last email:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="/assets/images/blog/3/4.png"
          alt="Company rep says that if I'm using cloudways, then they might be doing something with my web app"
          class="border-2 border-gray-500"
        />
        <figcaption>THE MYSTERY CONTINUES</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Sounds ominous. I don't really understand what they're trying to get at
        here, but it seems like they're trying to shift the blame towards
        <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/">Cloudways</a>, which is a
        cloud-hosting platform that just so happened to have its name as part of
        the subdomain of the clone: "cloudways-delete"
      </p>
      <p>
        But the thing is... I don't use Cloudways. At the time of the
        correspondence, my web app had been hosted on
        <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>. I've since
        moved on to
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/">AWS Lightsail</a>, but
        that's a story for another time (summary: it's cheaper).
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention, the fact that the clone went AWOL after my email proved
        that <strong>they</strong> had control over it.
        <strong>They</strong> had the power to take the clone down, which was
        hosted as a subdomain on <strong>their</strong> website, which
        presumably means <strong>they</strong> were the ones who started this
        whole fiasco.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only basis for Cloudways' involvement is that the phrase "cloudways"
        was part of the subdomain, and what if that's just a name and doesn't
        mean anything of importance?
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know. To be perfectly honest, I don't have enough information to
        explore the "cloudways-was-behind-everything" hypothesis, and from what
        I <strong>do</strong> know, that hypothesis is probably garbage that a
        panicking company is trying to push to avoid any potential legal action.
      </p>
      <p>
        And even if I did have convincing information suggesting that Cloudways
        was the bad actor, I don't know if I'd care.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least in this case, I'm not looking for revenge. And look, I get it.
        Revenge is satisfying. But I'd rather just let it go and get on with my
        life. That's why I've blackened out parts of the screenshots: I'm not
        trying for a "name-and-shame" style of blog post.
        <strong
          >As long as the clone stays dead and doesn't keep coming back like a
          Resident Evil villain, I'm happy.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        So that's that. As of writing, it's been about two months since that
        last email, and I've had no further correspondence with the company.
        Google has acted on my DMCA takedown request, and if you were to look up
        the web app today, you'd see no clone...
      </p>
      <p>...just the OG, baby.</p>
