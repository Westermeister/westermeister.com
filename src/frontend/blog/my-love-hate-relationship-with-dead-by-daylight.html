        (This post is about the video game "Dead by Daylight". If you're not
        familiar with the game, you can learn more about it
        <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/en">here</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Dead by Daylight. I first learned about the game when watching some of
        my favorite youtubers have a blast playing it. Although it looked fairly
        fun, I put off actually playing it for years: I was always kind of
        nervous when it came to horror games, and being a spectator was a much
        lower bar to reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, I decided to be brave. I still remember my first game of DBD. I
        was a survivor and I didn't know what the fuck I was doing. Well,
        actually I did, because I had watched so much of the game. Nevertheless,
        playing it was a whole new level of intensity. I lucked out: the killer
        focused on my teammates for pretty much the entire game, and I ended up
        being the only escapee. It was still terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe it was that fear, the intensity, that got me hooked on DBD. The
        raw emotion of being chased and hunted down was an incredible feeling. I
        remember one notable moment that solidified this notion. It was the
        endgame and a Doctor had hooked and camped a poor survivor. My teammates
        left. I, on the other hand, attempted a rescue, but I was too late. I
        ended up leaving too, but not before a terrifying game of hide-and-seek,
        then a short chase to the exit gate. I don't know why it happened, but
        after I escaped, my body started to tense. I could feel everything
        tingle. I was having a panic attack. No game ever did that to me before.
        I was starstruck.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it wasn't just being chased that was exhilarating: the other side of
        the coin was surprisingly fun as well. When I first started playing
        killer, I opted for Ghostface, a silent hunter that stalks his prey
        before readying for the killing blow. I had a blast playing him. Every
        little mindgame, every little trick that threw the survivors off - it
        was all so satisfying. I remember one time where I baited a pallet save
        by crouching on a downed survivor. Moments like that made DBD worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had great moments with other killers too. Playing as Bubba, I remember
        getting a multi-down chainsaw sweep on an overly-altruistic survivor and
        their freshly-unhooked friend. As Nurse, I pulled off an insane
        blink-down combo through a large obstacle. As Wraith, I befriended a
        survivor that gifted me their item - talk about wholesome!
      </p>
      <p>â€¦so where did everything go wrong?</p>
      <p>
        In some ways, my initial excitement with DBD was simply about its
        novelty. There's not many asymmetrical online games; at least, not many
        with a decent-sized online community. Even fewer games possess both that
        and the horror aspect of chasing and being chased. DBD is just a pretty
        unique game.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after that initial novelty wore off, and I started to gain
        experience and move up the MMR system, things changed for the worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with the survivor perspective: one of the worst things I've
        begun to feel when playing as a survivor is how
        <strong>hopeless</strong> it can feel. Once I got to the red ranks (or
        grades, as they're called now), I started to go against killers that
        were, to put it plainly, insanely good. Don't get me wrong: I'm not
        complaining about having an actual challenge. All I want is for it to be
        <strong>balanced</strong>. I don't want to feel dominated in almost
        every game, and neither do I want the killers to feel that. But in
        practice, that's what started to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the worst examples of this was a game where I was playing against
        a Hag. This Hag wasn't messing around. She tunneled her first hook into
        a second hook in the basement. Then, in typical Hag fashion, she set up
        a boatload of traps. An altruistic teammate bravely went in for the
        save, and actually managed to do a trade, thanks to Borrowed Time. The
        next teammate to go in wasn't so lucky. They ended up getting downed and
        hooked, so now there were two people stuck in a trap-filled basement.
        Needless to say, the rest of that game didn't end well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another time, I was going against a Pyramid Head who had a pretty strong
        start, with 4 hooks (including 1 death) at 4 gens. After the next death,
        I and one other teammate basically spent several minutes trading hooks.
        All that time, we both knew the game was over, and that only one of us
        was gonna make it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's what I hate the most about playing as a survivor:
        <strong>hopelessness</strong>. The feeling that a game was over at the
        halfway point. The knowledge that, absent some miraculous comeback, this
        was gonna be a "hatch match". The fact that, in order to escape through
        said hatch, I'd have to execute an incredibly boring strategy: sit in a
        locker, hide in a corner of the map, wait for my teammate to die, then
        <strong>maybe</strong> get the hatch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hate feeling hopeless. And as I played more and more games in the red
        ranks, hopelessness is what I continued to feel. More games where the
        killer just trashed the survivors. More games where things were over
        before they even started. More camping. More tunneling. More sweat. It
        just got overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what did I do? I turned my back on survivor, and started playing more
        killer rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        To cut to the chase, playing as a killer felt better, but it wasn't a
        bulletproof experience by any means. It was more about picking my
        poison. It's always thrilling to hunt, down, and sacrifice survivors,
        but there was always an element of <strong>stress</strong> in the
        background. Playing killer is a nuanced game of time management,
        choosing your battles, and min-maxing the hell out of each and every
        play. In other words, it feels like <strong>life</strong>. And life is
        exactly what I'm trying to escape when I play a video game!
      </p>
      <p>
        DBD is a dilemma. Playing as a survivor means dealing with
        <strong>hopelessness</strong>. It means knowing that your team has
        collapsed, and that there's little that you (a single person on a 4-man
        team) can do to turn things around. Playing as a killer means dealing
        with <strong>stress</strong>. It means shouldering the intense burden of
        the 4v1, and knowing that everything depends on you and you alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as much as DBD can be hell, it can also be heaven. It's incredibly
        rewarding to pull off an endgame rescue as a survivor, or pull off an
        amazing play as a killer. Those stories I mentioned near the beginning
        of this essay - those amazing experiences - those still happen from time
        to time!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why I have a love-hate relationship with DBD. It's a "high
        variance" game. You never know what to expect when you load into a
        match. When amazing things happen, they're beyond amazing. And when
        heartbreaking things happen, they're beyond heartbreaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the time I bought DBD almost 2 years ago, I've both installed it
        and uninstalled it several times. Each time, I tell myself that this is
        it. I'm either committing to playing more DBD because it's awesome, or
        committing to never playing it again because it's awful.
      </p>
      <p>I just wish I could make up my damn mind.</p>
