# 2021.08.01.2
- Fix minor typo in blog post: "Are Software Engineers Really Engineers?"

# 2021.08.01.1
- Changes to blog post: "Are Software Engineers Really Engineers?"
  - Fixed bug where the "Updated on" datetime doesn't appear on its own line.
  - Modified footer to contain a `div` tag instead of a `p` tag to avoid misleading semantics.

# 2021.08.01
- Major rewrite of blog post: "Are Software Engineers Really Engineers?"
  - The updated post, unlike the original, is not licensed under [CC BY-SA
    4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
- Changed styling of footer for blog posts: the copyright notice is now centered instead of being left-aligned with the
  blog post's text.

# 2021.07.31.1
- Added copyright notices (as comments) to homepage and main stylesheet.

# 2021.07.31
- Modified styling of cover picture's credit line for blog posts. No longer has a border, nor any opacity animations.
  - This change makes the credit line look more minimalistic and clean.

# 2021.07.26.1
- Added missing `transition` class for homepage's blog post cards.
  - This might be unnecessary, since the pop-up animation seems to work fine regardless. However, all examples for
    transitions in the Tailwind docs included the `transition` class, so it's probably better to err on the side of
    caution.

# 2021.07.26
- Initial deploy with basic homepage and first blog post: "Are Software Engineers Really Engineers?"
