# 2021.07.31.1
- Added copyright notices (as comments) to homepage and main stylesheet.

# 2021.07.31
- Modified styling of cover picture's credit line for blog posts. No longer has a border, nor any opacity animations.
  - This change makes the credit line look more minimalistic and clean.

# 2021.07.26.1
- Added missing `transition` class for homepage's blog post cards.
  - This might be unnecessary, since the pop-up animation seems to work fine regardless. However, all examples for
    transitions in the Tailwind docs included the `transition` class, so it's probably better to err on the side of
    caution.

# 2021.07.26
- Initial deploy with basic homepage and first post.
