# 2021.07.26.1
- Added this changelog.
- Added missing `transition` class for homepage's blog post cards. May be unnecessary (since pop-up animation seems to
  work fine), but all examples for transitions in the Tailwind docs included it, so probably better to err on the side
  of safety.

# 2021.07.26
- Initial deploy with basic homepage and first post.
